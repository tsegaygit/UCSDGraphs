Class: MapGraph

Modifications made to MapGraph (what and why):

added new private member variable to represent the vertices of the graph

updated class MapGraph constructor to initialize the vertices member variable with an empty graph

Implemented getNumVertices method that returns the number of vertices in the graph

Implemented getVertices method that returns the intersections, which are the vertices in this graph.

Implemented getNumEdges method that returns the number of edges in the graph which is the number of road segments in the graph

Implemented addVertex(GeographicPoint location) method that adds a node corresponding to an intersection at a Geographic Point

Implemented addEdge(GeographicPoint from, GeographicPoint to, String roadName,
			String roadType, double length) method that adds a directed edge to the graph from point A to point B
implemented bfs(GeographicPoint start, 
			 					     GeographicPoint goal, Consumer<GeographicPoint> nodeSearched) method that finds the path from start to goal using breadth first search			
added new supporting method , dfsSearch(MapNode start, MapNode goal, 
			HashMap<MapNode, MapNode> parentMap, Consumer<GeographicPoint> nodeSearched),  to perform breadth first search
		
added new supporting method, constructPath(MapNode start, MapNode goal,
			HashMap<MapNode, MapNode> parentMap), that will construct the path from point A to point B
			
			
Class: MapNode

Purpose and description of class: 
A class to represent a Node in a graph which is an intersection between two edges or streets on a map. The class has two private members, 
location which is (longitude, latitude) location of the node in the graph and a list of edges.

The class exposes several public methods 
	
Class: MapEdge

Purpose and description of class: 
A class to represent an Edge on a graph which is a line between two adjacent nodes or street that connects two adjacent nodes

This class contains a start and end points, which are nodes in the graph. It also contains several properties to capture edge information like road name, road type and edge length.

This class exposes public accessor methods
